# To get started with Dependabot version updates, you'll need to specify which
# package ecosystems to update and where the package manifests are located.
# Please see the documentation for all configuration options:
# https://docs.github.com/github/administering-a-repository/configuration-options-for-dependency-updates

version: 2
updates:
  # Enable version updates for npm
  - package-ecosystem: "npm"
    # Look for `package.json` and `lock` files in the `root` directory
    directory: "/"
    # Check the npm registry for updates once a week
    schedule:
      interval: "monthly"
    # Without versioning-strategy increase, the package-lock.json of the consuming
    # package would prevent updates of our dependencies. By also increasing the package.json
    # we make sure that the package-lock of the consuming package is also updating.
    versioning-strategy: increase
